  - [DONE] Why does isProfileEmpty exist for relationshipPerson and relationPerson [?]
  - [DONE] relationshipPerson and familyMemberObj should NOT contain the profile, just the uniqueId
    - [DONE] When editting (/edit), these values should be retreived through computed or methods ($store.getters.getProfileById(___))

      - [DONE] Do not show any buttons (+ / -)
      - [DONE] Everything "disabled" [?]
    - [DONE] Edit will be /edit (same Component as /create)
  - [DONE] When a familyMember is added using an existing profile, then the existing profile should be updated with the new relation as well
    - [DONE] EX) If Person 1 is Father of Person 2. Then Person 2 is Son/Daughter of Person 1.
    - [DONE] Would require Gender field to be filled out in order to auto-create relation. (otherwise it would not)
    - [DONE] Would require existing profile to link to.
    - [DONE] Relations:
        - [DONE] Grandfather / Grandmother <--> Grandson / Granddaughter
        - [DONE] Father / Mother <--> Daughter / Son
        - [DONE] Brother / Sister <--> Brother / Sister

        - [DONE]  Gender neutral relatinos too (Grandparent, Grandchild, Parent, Child, Sibling, Nibling)
    - [Done] Relationships:
        - [Needed?] Married <--> Married
        - [Needed?] In a Relationship <--> In a Relationship
        - [Needed?] Engaged <--> Engaged
  - [DONE] Check for errors when going between Create -> Profile -> Edit -> Profile -> Delete -> Home -> ETC...
    - [DONE] Will need to recreate the Profiles at some point
  - [DONE] When Profile is deleted, all profiles it is linked to should get updated (profile removed).
    - [DONE] Get working for Relationship
  - [DONE] Edits to family should also change the other Profile
  - [DONE] Changes to relationship (to Single) should remove relationshipPerson
    - [DONE] Edits to relationship should also change the other Profile
  - [DONE] Don't allow a person to be in a relationship with more than 1 person
    - [DONE] Check if profile is already in a relationship
    - NOTE: This is kind of "DONE". Profiles in relationships won't be searchable.




  - Fill out with information (McInnes & Misitano Family)




  - Create a "filter" on the main page that can filter through all of the existing Profiles
    - Dropdown vs Text Search
      - Text Search would work like "searchAllProfilesByName()"
      - Dropdown would filter by... Relation? Gender? Relationship?
    - Combobox [?]
      - Dropdown && Text Search




  - ProfileUtils.js [?] Should have a utilitiy class for all the things you can get from a Profile
    - fullName()
    - initials()

  - When screen is very small (xs or sm), remove Image from ProfileCard (just show name)

  - Create Sign In Page
    - Create Admin signIn
    - Only Admin will be able to "Create Profile" (and edit/delete Profiles)
